# Predict Student's Secondary School Performance

## Purpose
This repository applies Business Intelligence (BI)/Data Mining (DM) techniques to predict student achievement in secondary education. This repository uses the BI & DM techniques discussed in its original data source, [Cortez & Silva 2008](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228780408_Using_data_mining_to_predict_secondary_school_student_performance). 

## Data
[Cortez & Silva 2008](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228780408_Using_data_mining_to_predict_secondary_school_student_performance) acquired their data from two public schools in the Alentejo region in Portugal. Data was acquired through two separate sources; (1) school reports with data such as grades and absences, and (2) questionnaires, with demographics, social, emotional, and school-related questions. Data names and definitions can be found [here]().
